Hi there! I'm not sure how you managed to stumble across my blog, but I'm glad that you're here :) 
What this blog is: 
 
- a collection of random musings and shower thoughts (which I sporadically update and only v occasionally flesh out)
- a dumping ground for my [existential angst](https://kwingading.github.io/2021/04/18/On-Being-Fickle/) (ft my feeble attempts at sounding poetic - definitely would have made Nabokov roll in his grave)
- a hodgepodge of written pieces on random topics - from [semi-coherent thoughts](https://kwingading.github.io/2020/10/02/Megaproject-Entrepreneurs/) on [AI Governance](https://kwingading.github.io/2021/08/30/Information-Privacy-in-the-US,-EU-and-China-Differences-in-Cultural-Conceptions-and-Regulatory-Stringency/) and [Linguistic theory](https://kwingading.github.io/2020/03/21/Understanding-First-Language-Acquisition/) to word vomit about whatever thought is looping through my head
- a place for me to note down some interesting ideas/facts that I've come across
 
What it is not:
 
- a repository of very polished and well-researched work
- a valuable resource teeming with creative and original thoughts
 
I'll add epistemic statuses to blog posts as I see fit, but take the above as a rule-of-thumb :) 
 
I've put together an archive of my existing posts below (which I am continuously updating); **each listed title links you to the corresponding post.**
