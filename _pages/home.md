Greetings wanderer! I'm not sure how you managed to stumble across my blog, but I'm glad that you're here :) 

What this blog is: 

- a collection of random musings and shower thoughts (which I sporadically update and only v occasionally flesh out)
- a hodgepodge of written pieces on random topics - from [semi-coherent thoughts](https://kwingading.github.io/2020/10/02/Megaproject-Entrepreneurs/) on [AI Diplomacy](https://kwingading.github.io/2021/03/16/Review-Contested-Chinese-Dreams-of-AI/) and [Linguistic theory](https://kwingading.github.io/2020/03/21/Understanding-First-Language-Acquisition/) to word vomit about whatever thought is looping through my head
- a place for me to note down some interesting ideas/facts that I've come across

What it is not:

- a repository of very polished and well-researched work
- a valuable resource teeming with creative and original thoughts

I'll add epistemic statuses to blog posts as I see fit, but take the above as a rule-of-thumb :) 

I've put together an archive of my existing posts below (which I am continuously updating).
