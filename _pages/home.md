Greetings wanderer! Welcome to my blog. I'm not sure how you stumbled across this place, but I'm glad that you're here :) 

What this blog is: 

- a collection of random musings and shower thoughts (which I sporadically update and only v occasionally flesh out)
- a hodgepodge of written pieces on random topics - from semi-coherent thoughts on AI Diplomacy and Linguistic theory to word vomit about whatever thought is looping through my head
- a place for me to note down some interesting ideas/facts that I've come across

What it is not:

- a repository of very polished and well-researched work
- a valuable resource teeming with creative and original thoughts

I'll add epistemic statuses to blog posts as I see fit, but take the above as a rule-of-thumb :) 

Happy reading!
