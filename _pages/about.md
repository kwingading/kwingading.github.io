**Please note that this bio is kinda out of date**

Hi there! I'm Kelly :) 

I'm trying to figure out how I can help usher in humanity's coolest era yet (all the while making sure that we don't kill ourselves during the process). I'm currently physically based in London 75% of the time and Hong Kong 25% of the time (though I'm always spiritually in some alternate fantasy-cyberpunk version of Edo Japan). 

I've been thinking a lot about beauty lately — and the dearth of it in modern day society :(  I've been trying to make up for it by reading Keats/Kawabata/Nabokov, loitering around St Paul's Cathedral (though my heart yearns for Ryoanji's Zen Rock Garden), gawking at Rubens' Samson and Delilah... etc. So please, if you've come across something beautiful lately and are happy to share (or can point me towards someone who has reflected on the subject a lot - Wilde and Mishima for example), I would love to hear from you.

Here are some other things that I'm focusing on right now: 

- Getting back into writing~ 
- Figuring out how to build human-like conversational voice assistants (my full time job)
- Reading about AI governance, strategy + diplomacy - especially topics concerning China
- Picking up Japanese again (something I've neglected in the past 4 years) -> would love a conversation buddy, so if you're a fluent Japanese speaker, hit me up!
    - I really *really* want live in Japan at some point! Sapporo would be amazing, as would Kyoto. Saitama seems to have a lot of capybaras though which makes it v v appealing to me
- Misc: 'jamming' (i.e. improv dancing to trashy music) - mainly during work/study breaks, cooking really good Japanese food (esp rice bowls!)

Here are some things that I've gotten up to in the last ~4 years:

- Finally got around to picking up some basic technical skills/knowledge (programming in Python, basic ML and stats --> I was literally spoon-fed frequentist stats but was thankfully taught on the side by a die-hard bayesian whom I love v v much :') )
- Read a lot about Linguistics
    - Areas that I found the most interesting: syntax (! !! !!!), semantics + pragmatics, language acquisition, cognitive neuroscience of language, language acquisition (first and second) → I spot a common theme - do you? Phonetics was super duper fun too, but I didn't find it as gripping as the other sub-disciplines. My only regret was that I didn't learn more about Linguistic typology.
    - I've also spent a sizable amount of time doing Linguistics-related activities that don't entail actual reading: drawing trees, making weird noises, analysing the speech peculiarities of others... I also gave some Linguistics tutoring lessons to high schoolers hoping to study the subject at uni.
- Did a research project at the intersection of China and AI strategy for a [**longtermist think-tank in China**](https://concordia-consulting.com/)
    - Actually (sort of) picked up the basics on navigating Chinese cyberspace. Also managed to put my very rusty Chinese reading skills to use. The auto-Google-Translate tool was useful for the first time - it saved me lots of time by translating Chinese texts from simplified to traditional (though I should really learn how to read simplified)
- Spent a summer working at an early-stage startup
    - My primary tasks included 1) designing + conducting a user study → analysing and presenting my findings → translating these into concrete business decisions 2)  designing + implementing the marketing strategy of an early-stage startup
- Constructed some NLP datasets
    - [**Multi-SimLex**](https://multisimlex.com/) - a "large-scale multilingual resource for lexical semantics"
    - PoliteInContext: a contextualised politeness dataset inspired by Terkourafi’s frame-based approach to politeness → this was my undergrad thesis so you won't be able to find this online :)
- Helped organise two Hackathons - always had so much fun during the actual event!
- Learnt about Learning Engineering + hosted an EdTech Careers Fair (w funding from Schmidt Futures)
- Danced danced danced (!!!). I experimented with various different styles:
    - Latin dancing
        - chachacha, jive mainly - but have also done some samba, rumba and paso doble
    - Ballroom dancing (waltz and quickstep)
        - I really wanted to learn Tango but it wasn't in the beginner's training syllabus. I was hoping of trying it this year but COVID-19 happened :(
    - Commercial +/ hip hop
        - Since COVID, my main source of dance choreographies has been [1 Million Dance Studio videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/1MILLIONDanceStudioofficial). I've v sporadically learnt random 1 Million choreos since high school, but have amped up the frequency of this recently. The studio has started releasing a lot more tutorials than they've used to but most of them aren't free — my typical learning method is finding a mirrored version of the dance on Youtube and slowing it down to 0.5.

In a previous life, I wrote a lot of fiction, tried learning a lot of languages and regularly jumped around on ice with very thin blades attached to my feet (with all due seriousness: blades on figure skates are only ~4mm thick which is actually insane). 

Feel free to reach out to me at lkw33cam [at] gmail [dot] com - I love meeting new people! I'm absolutely abysmal at replying messages/emails so please expect a delay in my response (it's nothing personal!).
