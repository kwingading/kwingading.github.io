Hi there! I'm Kelly :) 

I'm trying to figure out how I can help usher in humanity's coolest and most beautiful era yet (all the while making sure that we don't kill ourselves during the process). I'm currently physically based in London 75% of the time and Hong Kong 25% of the time (though I'm always spiritually in some alternate version of the Heian Imperial Court). 

Here are some things that I've gotten up to in the last half a decade:

- ‘Jamming’ (i.e. improv dancing to trashy music). Anyone who has spent more than an hour with me knows that I can’t keep still when I hear my music. For context, I’ve once been called out for bopping to the sound of the London tube (eheheh). London’s also been a huge enabler in encouraging my dancing addiction. I normally go to Pineapple/Base for Commercial + Hip Hop (and the very occasional wild card class like Chinese dance). Did some Latin+Ballroom dancing for a year back in Uni as well. 
- Finally got around to picking up some basic technical skills/knowledge (programming in Python, basic ML and stats --> I was literally spoon-fed frequentist stats but was thankfully taught on the side for a bit by a die-hard bayesian)
- Read a lot about Linguistics
    - Areas that I found the most interesting: syntax (! !! !!!), semantics + pragmatics, language acquisition, cognitive neuroscience of language, language acquisition (first and second) → I spot a common theme - do you? Phonetics was super duper fun too, but I didn't find it as gripping as the other sub-disciplines. My only regret was that I didn't learn more about Linguistic typology.
    - I've also spent a sizable amount of time doing Linguistics-related activities that don't entail actual reading: drawing trees, making weird noises, analysing the speech peculiarities of others... I also gave some Linguistics tutoring lessons to high schoolers hoping to study the subject at uni.
- Constructed some NLP datasets
    - [**Multi-SimLex**](https://multisimlex.com/) - a "large-scale multilingual resource for lexical semantics"
    - PoliteInContext: a contextualised politeness dataset inspired by Terkourafi’s frame-based approach to politeness → this was my undergrad thesis so you won't be able to find this online :)
- Did a research project at the intersection of China and AI strategy for a [**longtermist think-tank in China**](https://concordia-consulting.com/)
    - Actually (sort of) picked up the basics on navigating Chinese cyberspace. Also managed to put my rusty Chinese reading skills to use. The auto-Google-Translate tool was useful for the first time - it saved me lots of time by translating Chinese texts from simplified to traditional (though I should really learn how to read simplified)
- Spent a summer working at an early-stage startup
    - My primary tasks included 1) designing + conducting a user study → analysing and presenting my findings → translating these into concrete business decisions 2)  designing + implementing the marketing strategy of an early-stage startup
- Helped organise two Hackathons - always had so much fun during the actual event!
- Learnt (a bit) about Learning Engineering + hosted an EdTech Careers Fair (w funding from Schmidt Futures)

In a previous life, I wrote a lot of fiction, tried learning a lot of languages and regularly jumped around on ice with very thin blades attached to my feet (with all due seriousness: blades on figure skates are only ~4mm thick which is actually insane). 

Feel free to reach out to me at lkw33cam [at] gmail [dot] com - I love meeting new people! I'm absolutely abysmal at replying messages/emails so please expect a delay in my response (it's nothing personal!). 

Side note: if you're looking for my institutional affiliations, you'll find them on my [**LinkedIn Profile**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-w-618b5b141/) (I try to leave conventional signalling to LinkedIn)
