Hello my lovelies - it has been awhile!

I've recently decided to migrate my recent and future writing to substack.

This move is partly me jumping onto the bandwagon, but also a conscious effort to focus more on sharing and writing for my friends.

As much as I love shouting into the void, I'm at a stage of my life right now where I want something more intimate and vulnerable.

Anyhow, much love to y'all <3
