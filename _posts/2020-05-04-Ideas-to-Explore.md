// to be updated + refined // 

I thought it'd be useful to keep a record of ideas that I want to explore further. I'm considering writing some blog posts on each topic:

- cooperation on different levels (esp interested in cooperation across cultures with different value systems, mechanisms for restructuring incentives), also keen to explore the differences in cooperation behaviour across different world cultures

- redesigning the education system (sn: when I say redesigning, I don't mean finding a single substitute. It's probably more useful to identify the goals we have and then considering how the new system(s) can take these into account - or even achieving the goals via other systems outside of education (I'm thinking of things like social development for kids))

- technocracy as an effective form of government 

- the role of public narratives + how memes shape public discourse (and hence policy, world events...) 

- technological progress (role of individuals, models of funding, state/private sector role...)

- how to reconcile emotion and reason (I often feel a disconnect between the two in terms of 'internalising' arguments/evidence. Emotion tends to be looked down upon as a 'base' means of motivating and understanding arguments, but it's a very powerful force - how do we best leverage it?)
