(to be updated + refined)

I thought it'd be useful to keep a record of ideas that I want to explore further. I'm considering writing some blog posts on each topic:

- cooperation (cultural values, restructuring incentives)

- redesigning the education system (sn: when I say redesigning, I don't mean finding a single substitute. It's probably more useful to identify the goals we have and then considering how the new system(s) can take these into account - or even achieving the goals via other systems outside of education (I'm thinking of things like social development for kids))

- technocracy as an effective form of government

- the role of public narratives 

- how to reconcile emotion and reason (I often feel a disconnect between the two in terms of 'internalising' arguments/evidence)
