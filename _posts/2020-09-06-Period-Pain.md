My periods started becoming really painful over a year ago. I suspected that I had a mild form of endometriosis at some point, but my confidence level in that hypothesis has waned recently. I tried Chinese Medicine last December/January for 4 weeks, but my period in January was excruciating so I stopped. I decided to give it another shot in July/August (3 weeks); my following period was still quite painful but the pain was definitely better. 

My temporary (and not v sustainable) solution is to take painkillers. During my last two periods, I attempted to brave it like a samurai and see how long I could hold off on the painkillers for. I lasted 5 hours the first time. 10 hours the second time. As you've probably guessed by now, I don't like painkillers. Although they do their job quite well (thank you arcoxia), they don't tackle the root of the problem (which imo is rarely if ever the optimal solution to any problem).

My plan-of-action for the next couple of months is to try a lifestyle-based approach. This was prompted by my reading of ""Period Repair Manual, Second Edition: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods" (Lara Briden ND and Jerilynn Prior)". The title sounds slightly new age-y, but the content itself is top-notch.

I feel like period pain can be completely avoidable. 

Interesting Facts[1]:
- It takes 100 days for your follicles to mature from their dormant state all the way to ovulation. If your follicles were unhealthy for any part of that maturation process, the result could be a period problem months later
- Eighty percent of your immune system is clustered around your digestion, where it’s in constant communication with your gut and gut bacteria.
- The conventional anti-inflammatory medication ibuprofen (AdvilⓇ or NurofenⓇ) reduces menstrual flow by half. It works by lowering the prostaglandins that contribute to heavy flow
