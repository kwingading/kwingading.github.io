My periods started becoming really painful over a year ago. I suspected that I had a mild form of endometriosis at some point, but my confidence level in that hypothesis has waned recently. I tried Chinese Medicine last December/January for 4 weeks, but my period in January was excruciating so I stopped. I decided to give it another shot in July/August (3 weeks); my following period was still quite painful but the pain was definitely better. 

My temporary (and not v sustainable) solution is to take painkillers. During my last two periods, I attempted to brave it like a samurai and see how long I could hold off on the painkillers for. I lasted 5 hours the first time. 10 hours the second time. As you've probably guessed by now, I don't like painkillers. Although they do their job quite well (thank you arcoxia), they don't tackle the root of the problem (which imo is rarely if ever the optimal solution to any problem).

My plan-of-action for the next couple of months is to try a lifestyle-based approach. This was prompted by my reading of ""Period Repair Manual, Second Edition: Natural Treatment for Better Hormones and Better Periods" (Lara Briden ND and Jerilynn Prior)". The title sounds slightly new age-y, but the content itself is top-notch. My plan is based on their research + recommendations (honestly - why is this not mandatory learning in schools?). 

Plan of action: 
- Consume more magnesuim, zinc, Vitamin B6
    - Magnesium rich foods include: dark chocolate, avocado, nuts (almonds, cashews, brazil nuts) and seeds (pumpkin seeds!), legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas,         peas and soybeans), tofu, whole grains (esp buckwheat and quinoa), fatty fish (salmon, mackerel and halibut), bananas, leafy greens (kale, spinach, collard         greens, turnip greens and mustard greens) [1]
    - Zinc rich foods include: red meat, shellfish, legumes, seeds, nuts, eggs, whole grains... [2]
    - B6 rich foods: salmon, tuna, eggs, liver, beef, carrots, spinach, sweet potato, peas, bananas, chick peas, avocado [3]
- Add anti-inflammatory foods into my diet 
    - Turmeric (!!), berries, fatty fish, broccoli, avocado, green tea (yeet!), peppers, mushrooms, grapes, cherries, dark chocolate [4]
- Minimize consumption of foods that are inflammatory (refined sugar/carbs - potentially wheat! <- rip I love carbs) and histamine-containing (red wine, fermented foods) /stimulating (i.e. dairy, alcohol) 
- The Classic: Destress!! Sleep well! Exercise!

Reducing PMS apparently requires one to:
- boost GABA
- enhance progesterone
- limit prostaglandins

Interesting Facts [5]:
- It takes 100 days for your follicles to mature from their dormant state all the way to ovulation. If your follicles were unhealthy for any part of that maturation process, the result could be a period problem months later.
- Eighty percent of your immune system is clustered around your digestion, where it’s in constant communication with your gut and gut bacteria.
- The conventional anti-inflammatory medication ibuprofen (AdvilⓇ or NurofenⓇ) reduces menstrual flow by half. It works by lowering the prostaglandins that contribute to heavy flow.
- Migraines are triggered by a drop in estrogen, which is why the premenstrual phase is a dangerous time for migraines.
- Yet another reason for premenstrual fatigue is the insomnia you might experience as your estrogen and progesterone drop away. Both hormones have direct sleep-enhancing effects and so losing them can disrupt sleep.
- Phytoestrogens occur in plant foods such as nuts, seeds, whole grains, and legumes. In a moderate amount, they are healthy. In a large amount, they can make periods lighter and sometimes even suppress ovulation.
- Symptoms of low progesterone include no luteal phase or a short luteal phase, fertile mucus during the premenstrual phase, PMS, premenstrual bleeding or spotting, and prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding.
- When you see a rise in temperature for at least three consecutive days, then you ovulated at the start of that rise. With a healthy corpus luteum, you will then see between eleven and sixteen high-temperature days between ovulation and the first day of your period.
- Estradiol is your happy hormone or “yang hormone.” It stimulates mood and libido because it boosts the neurotransmitters serotonin (which promotes feelings of well-being and happiness) and dopamine. The more estradiol you have, the thicker your uterine lining, and the heavier your period will eventually be.
- Fertile mucus contains microscopic “sperm escalators” that hasten sperm into your uterus.
- By thinning your uterine lining, progesterone can lighten your period.
- If you do not become pregnant, then your corpus luteum has the tiny lifespan of a butterfly. It will survive only ten to sixteen days, which is what defines your luteal phase. That is why (unless you are pregnant), your luteal phase can never be longer than sixteen days.
- Normal period pain is caused by the release of prostaglandins in your uterus. Having more estrogen and less progesterone can cause a higher level of prostaglandins and more period pain.
- If you can see fertile mucus after ovulation. It doesn’t mean you’re going to ovulate again. It means you did not make enough progesterone to dry up the fertile mucus.
- The higher your estrogen, the further your fall. The withdrawal from estrogen can cause fatigue, night sweats, and migraines.
- Inflammation can cause 1) less progesterone and GABA, and 2) more estrogen (side note: given the earlier facts above - this isn't great for PMS!).
