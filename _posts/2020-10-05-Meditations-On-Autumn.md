__"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun..."__  ‚Äì To Autumn, John Keats üçÅ 

October is finally here! This is around the time of year where Keats features (semi)prominently in my head. Every time I walk through the lush landscape of red, orange and yellow, I can hear his words circulating at the back of my mind. For the past two years, when returning to my room from the centre of Cambridge, I would always take the path through Trinity's backs. Once you leave the back gate of college and go over the bridge, you'll find yourself in a path lined with looming/towering trees on either side [1]. The changing of the seasons always was the most obvious here. When I first arrive in college during Michaelmas term, I would only see green. As we venture deeper into October, the leaves turn yellow/golden/orange . Once this happens, within a span of the week, the trees will become completely bare and will remain so until April. To me, the beauty of autumn is compounded by its transient nature ‚Äî autumn is a burst of colour before winter, like the sudden yet short-lived rush of sweetness taste when bursting a very ripe grape in one's mouth (cfr: "...Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine..." [2]).

Although I've always been fairly excited about the arrival of autumn, I also get quite nostalgic for the summer heat [3]. The UK is weird in that the beginnings of autumn start creeping in at around August (or so you think ‚Äî because it gets so so cold), and then suddenly, at the mid-end of September, the universe decides to through you a curveball in the form of a week of sun and __summer__.  However, when October rolls around and the cold starts to set in, you know that this time it is here to stay [4].

[1] I am ashamed to say that I have no idea what kind of trees they are. If someone could so very kindly tell me ‚Äî I've attached a photo of the trees in the backs above. I've tried Google, but I guess Google doesn't actually know everything.

[3] Though to be fair, I didn't really experience autumn until I went to the UK; Hong Kong isn't exactly known for having a 'proper' four seasons (I can wear a tank top during mid-December and I'm the kind of person who is always cold).
[4] Fun fact: this blog post was originally going to be about careers and grad schemes, with autumn + October being a lead into the piece. However, as you can clearly see, I got carried away with autumn and just wasn't in headspace to think about pragmatic matters anymore. This is a good thing: meditating on the beauty of autumn is much more important than stressing about 'grad schemes'.
