__"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun..."__  – To Autumn, John Keats 🍁 

October is finally here! This is around the time of year where Keats features (semi)prominently in my head. Every time I walk through the lush landscape of red, orange and yellow, I can hear his words circulating at the back of my mind. For the past two years, when returning to my room from the centre of Cambridge, I would always take the path through Trinity's backs. Once you leave the back gate of college and go over the bridge, you'll find yourself in a path lined with looming/towering trees on either side [1]. The changing of the seasons always was the most obvious here. When I first arrive in college during Michaelmas term, I would only see green. As we venture deeper into October, the leaves turn yellow/golden/orange . Once this happens, within a span of the week, the trees will become completely bare and will remain so until April. To me, the beauty of autumn is compounded by its transient nature — autumn is a burst of colour before winter, like the sudden yet short-lived rush of sweetness taste when bursting a very ripe grape in one's mouth (cfr: "...Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine..." [2]).

Although I've always been fairly excited about the arrival of autumn, I also get quite nostalgic for the summer heat [3]. The UK is weird in that the beginnings of autumn start creeping in at around August (or so you think — because it gets so so cold), and then suddenly, at the mid-end of September, the universe decides to through you a curveball in the form of a week of sun and __summer__.  However, when October rolls around and the cold starts to set in, you know that this time it is here to stay [4].

[1] I am ashamed to say that I have no idea what kind of trees they are. If someone could so very kindly tell me — I've attached a photo of the trees in the backs above. I've tried Google, but I guess Google doesn't actually know everything. 

[2]  Ode on Melancholy — Remember what I said about Keats always being in the back of my mind during Autumn?

[3] Though to be fair, I didn't really experience autumn until I went to the UK; Hong Kong isn't exactly known for having a 'proper' four seasons (I can wear a tank top during mid-December and I'm the kind of person who is always cold).

[4] Fun fact: this blog post was originally going to be about careers and grad schemes, with autumn + October being a lead into the piece. However, as you can clearly see, I got carried away with autumn and just wasn't in headspace to think about pragmatic matters anymore. This is a good thing: meditating on the beauty of autumn is much more important than stressing about 'grad schemes'.
